const aboutMe = `I'm Kay, a Penultimate Software Engineering student at the University of Auckland.
In my free time, I like to play chess and speedcube. I also love to train calisthenics 
to keep myself fit and active to compensate for all the hours sitting at my desk coding Orz.

My interest in speedcubing significantly influenced my decision to specialise in software engineering. 
In many ways, solving coding problems is similar to solving a Rubik's cube - it requires breaking down 
the solution into smaller and more manageable parts and finding elegant and efficient 
solutions to optimise the time taken to complete the cube. My experience in speedcubing has taught me 
the importance of creativity, attention to detail, and solution optimisation, all of 
which are crucial skills in software development. 

I am currently learning fullstack development, 
which I am enjoying a lot; learning how the front and back end is integrated is really interesting to me,
and I love the feeling when my imagination of a website comes to fruition.`
